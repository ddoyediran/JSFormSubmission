# JavaScript Form Submission Project
This is a simple JavaScript Form Submission Project that forwarded form details enter by the users to an email address. Simply put, when a user fills form fields, the form details entered by the user will be forwarded or sent to your email address when the user hits submit button. This was achieved using Nodejs, Expressjs, Nodemailer and Jade. In this short project I used couple of dependency like:

### Nodemailer - to send the form details to your prefered email address.

### Expressjs (for Routing).

### Nodejs For Backend 

### Bootstrap template for the Frontend.
P.S: I converted the Html to Jade. To do that, paste your html code to this website [Html2Jade](https://html2jade.org/)

Here is an example:

Html: Synthax in HTML - How it looks in HTML
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>HTML to Jade</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Jade - node template engine</h1>
  <div class="col" id="container">
    <p>It is easy and fun to convert Html to Jade!</p>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

Jade: Syntax in Jade - How it looks in Jade:

```
doctype html
html(lang='en')
  head
    title HTML to Jade
  body
    h1 Jade - node template engine
    #container.col
      p It is easy and fun to convert Html to Jade!
```
